## Data protection and scope

This release contains derived, de-identified review data. It does not redistribute full-text articles, copyrighted source excerpts, source-text snippets, internal workbook locators, or system-specific identifiers. Reviewer-specific raw A/B coding is not included; reliability is provided as aggregate output.

The report identifiers are study-tracking identifiers created for this review and are not external persistent identifiers. In `report_bibliography.csv`, a blank DOI indicates that no DOI was recorded for that report in the final source registry; the corresponding source URL is retained where available. Interpretations should follow the codebook and denominator guide. `Not reported`, `Unclear`, and `Not applicable` are distinct states and should not be collapsed without reference to the manuscript definitions.

## Reuse and citation

This release is intended to support verification and reuse of the descriptive analyses reported in the associated scoping review. A repository DOI and license will be added after the public release is finalized. Until then, please cite the associated manuscript and identify this release as version 1.0.2.

## Provenance

The release was derived from the final submission appendices prepared for the revised manuscript. The release package was generated without exporting the source-excerpt and internal-audit columns from those workbooks.
